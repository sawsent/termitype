A clean, minimal, fully-terminal typing test — inspired by Monkeytype, built for people who love the terminal.

Termitype focuses on:

- a refined terminal UI
- extensibility through adapters (macOS, Linux, Windows/PowerShell)  
- portability with zero external frameworks  
- a simple, fast typing experience

---

## Features

### ✔ Minimal, beautiful terminal UI  
A clean interface built specifically for terminal environments.  
Fully adjustable **width** and **height** via settings.

### ✔ Real-time typing test  
- Randomized words  
- Accurate cursor simulation  
- Inline mistake highlighting  
- Previous, current, and next words clearly spaced  

### ✔ Settings screen with full-text search  
Settings are now searchable: type to filter options instantly.

### ✔ End-of-run results screen  
Shows:
- WPM  
- Accuracy  
- Duration  
- A diff-style view comparing typed vs expected text  

### ✔ Adapter-based architecture  
All OS-specific terminal behavior (cursor movement, color support, input handling) is abstracted.  
Termitype works equally well on:
- macOS (Terminal, iTerm2) (implemented)
- Linux (not implemented)
- Windows Terminal / PowerShell (not implemented)

### ✔ Persistent run storage  
Store:
- WPM  
- accuracy  
- date/time
